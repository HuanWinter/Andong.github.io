title: Reflection Detection of GNSS RO Measurements
description: >
  Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) has been widely used in the prediction of weather, climate, and space weather, particularly in the area of tropospheric analyses. However, one of the issues with GNSS RO measurements is that they are interfered with by the signals reflected from the earth's surface. Many GNSS RO events are subject to such interfered GNSS measurements, which are considerably difficult to extract from the GNSS RO measurements.

To precisely identify interfered RO events, an improved machine learning approach-an artificial neural network (ANN)-aided radio-holography method is proposed in this paper. This approach was validated using Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate/FC-3 atmPhs (level 1b) data during the period of day of year 172-202, 2015, and its detection results were compared with the flag data set provided by Radio Occultation Meteorology Satellite Application Facilities for the performance assessment and validation of the new approach.

## Holographic Metrics

![Electric_field](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;E(t)=A(t)\exp(i\phi(t)))

![Hologram](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\Delta E(t)=\frac{E(t)}{E^m(t)}=A(t)\exp(i\phi(t)-i\phi^m(t)))


where ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;A(t)) and ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\phi(t)) are  the  SNR  (which  is  regarded  as the  amplitude)  and  phase  of  the  signal  respectively  at epoch t, and	ùëñ is  the  symbol for imaginaries.  

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\phi^m(t)) obtained  by  the one-dimensional  second-order function best fitted to the raw excess phase.  Then ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\Delta E(t)) is  decomposed  from  the time  domain  to  the frequency  domain  by  the Multiple  Signal  Classification (MUSIC) algorithm for producing radio holographic  matrices.
